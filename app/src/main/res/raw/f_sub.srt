0
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,480
Hiding from the rain and snow

1
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,700
Trying to forget but I won't let go

2
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,780
Looking at a crowded street

3
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,940
Listening to my own heart beat

4
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,660
So many people all around the world

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:48,060
Tell me where do I find someone like you girl

6
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,060
Take me to your heart take me to your soul

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,800
Give me your hand before I'm old

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,800
Show me what love is - haven't got a clue

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,780
Show me that wonders can be true

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,340
They say nothing lasts forever

11
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,900
We're only here today

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,360
Love is now or never

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,440
Bring me far away

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,360
Take me to your heart take me to your soul

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,480
Give me your hand and hold me

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,140
Show me what love is - be my guiding star

17
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,780
It's easy take me to your heart

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,700
Standing on a mountain high

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,860
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky

20
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,320
I should go and see some friends

21
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,580
But they don't really comprehend

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Don't need too much talking without saying anything

23
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,700
All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing

24
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,060
Take me to your heart take me to your soul

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,100
Give me your hand before I'm old

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,860
Show me what love is - haven't got a clue

27
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,960
Show me that wonders can be true

28
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,180
They say nothing lasts forever

29
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,160
We're only here today

30
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,420
Love is now or never

31
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,080
Bring me far away

32
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,220
Take me to your heart take me to your soul

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Give me your hand and hold me

34
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,300
Show me what love is - be my guiding star
